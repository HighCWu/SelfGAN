This repository contains the official implementation of the following casual paper:

[SelfGAN](https://vixra.org/abs/1902.0445)

Additional pretrained models and training results can be found in Google Drive folder:

## Remind

The parts of the source code about Self Pix2Pix and Self CycleGAN have not been fully tested, and I have no energy to work hard in this area for the time being.
